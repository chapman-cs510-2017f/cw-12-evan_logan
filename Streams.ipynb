C++, being built on C, handles them similarly, but it is done in another class and hides the nitty-gritty details of how strings actually behave, considering they are arrays of chars."

    "**IOStream Differences:** reading from the command line doesn't change much, the notation and syntax for main() does not change significantly. However, C++ has a more sophisticated documantion for iostreams by using >> and << symbols, and also defining the type of data being output. for example, ofstream is its own class for handling the output of files. std error, and printing is used with the symbol << and >>, which handles input and output. for printing, cout works and for error, cerr works with << to begin outputing errors & printing."
